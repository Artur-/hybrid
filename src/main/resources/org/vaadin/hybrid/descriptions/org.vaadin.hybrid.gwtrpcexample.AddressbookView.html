<h1>Client-side GWT-RPC Example</h1>

<p>This example has been completely implemented on the client-side using GWT-RPC.</p>

<p>It consists of the following classes:
<ul>
	<li>AddressbookEditor: UI implementation compiled to JavaScript.</li>
	<li>AddressbookService: Public service interface for accessing the backend. This is implemented by the service servlet.</li>
	<li>AddressbookServiceImpl: Servlet implementing the service proxy to the backend.</li>
	<li>AddressbookServiceAsync: Asynchronous version of the service interface. This is used from the client to access the service over HTTP.</li>
	<li>AddressbookView: Server-side view that puts the widget on the page. In a GWT app this would be replaced by a static HTML page.</li>
	<li>AddressbookConnector: Initializer for the client-side widget. In a GWT app this would be replaced by the EntryPoint.</li>
</ul>
</p>
