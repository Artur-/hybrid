<h1>Client-side Connector Example</h1>

<p>This example has been completely implemented on the client-side using Vaadin Connectors for communication with the backend.</p>

<p>It consists of the following classes:
<ul>
	<li>AddressbookEditor: UI implementation compiled to JavaScript. Communicates with server-side AddressbookView.</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorServerRpc: RPC interface which AddressbookEditor uses to communicate with server-side AddressbookView (client to server).</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorClientRpc: RPC interface which server-side AddressbookView uses to communicate with AddressbookEditor (server to client).</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorState: Contains addresses which are automatically synchronized (server to client) automatically.</li>
	<li>AddressbookView: Server-side view that puts the widget on the page. Handles RPC calls from AddressBookEditor and forwards to the backend.</li> 
	<li>AddressbookConnector: Initializer for the client-side widget.</li>
</ul>
</p>
